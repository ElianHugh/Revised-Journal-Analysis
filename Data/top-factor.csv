If the study includes original data, at least one author must confirm that he or she had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

The journal encourages all authors to share the data and other artefacts supporting the results in the paper by archiving it in an appropriate public repository. Authors may provide a data availability statement, including a link to the repository they have used, in order that this statement can be published in their paper. Shared data should be cited.

More information is available here

Failure to do so before acceptance will result in rejection of the paper and after acceptance in retraction of the paper.",0,The journal encourages all authors to share the data and other artefacts supporting the results in the paper by archiving it in an appropriate public repository.,0,The journal encourages all authors to share the data and other artefacts supporting the results in the paper by archiving it in an appropriate public repository. ,2,"Randomised controlled trials
The Journal requires authors to conform to CONSORT 2010 (see CONSORT Statement) in relation to the reporting of randomised controlled clinical trials; also recommended is the Extensions of the CONSORT Statement with regard to cluster randomised controlled trials.In particular, authors of RCTs must include in their paper a flow chart illustrating the progress of subjects through the trial (CONSORT diagram) and the CONSORT checklist. The flow diagram should appear in the main paper, the checklist in the online Appendix.

Systematic Reviews
Systematic reviews should conform to the PRISMA guidelines.
",0,"Randomised controlled trials
...Trial registry name, registration identification number, and the URL for the registry should also be included at the end of the methods section of the Abstract and again in the Methods section of the main text, and in the online manuscript submission. The manuscript should include sample size calculation and should specify primary and secondary trial outcomes/endpoints.

Trials should be registered in one of the ICJME-recognised trial registries such as:

Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry https://www.anzctr.org.au/
Clinical Trials http://www.clinicaltrials.gov
ISRCTN Register http://isrctn.org
Nederlands Trial Register http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp
UMIN Clinical Trials Registry http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr

Trial registration must include a pre-registered, date stamped, publicly available protocol setting out, at least, the research question, hypotheses, primary outcome and statistics plan. These requirements apply to all trials whatever their academic provenance (i.e., including trials of educational and social work interventions) or whether they include a clinical outcome (i.e., those trials that focus on a mechanism of action rather than symptoms or functional impairment retain the requirement for pre-registration). Authors must state whether the primary trial report is referenced and if they have identified the study as a secondary analysis of existing trial data.

Systematic Reviews
...The journal strongly encourages the pre-registration of review protocols on publicly accessible platforms. From 2021 this will be mandatory.

Other submissions
Pre-registration of studies with all other types of designs on publicly available platforms is encouraged. All pre-registered studies accepted for publication will be flagged following publication.

At Stage 1 (before results) the manuscript will be assessed on the basis of how strong the hypotheses are and whether the methodology and design are robust and promising. At this point the paper can be accepted in principle or rejected. If accepted in principle then the final article should be accepted unless the final manuscript fails to conduct the study originally described. The Stage 1 manuscript should include: introduction - spelling out why the study is important; methods - including information to interpret whether the study is sufficiently well-powered to find a positive result (or to interpret a null result); analysis - detailing as fully as possible the analysis steps that will be used. The Stage 1 submission may also include pilot data, but this is not required. Stage 1 acceptance is conditional on the authors also submitting, immediately after Stage 1 acceptance, a formal registration to an appropriate repository such as the Open Science Framework (see https://osf.io/rr/). At Stage 2 (after results), you should add the data and analyses previously described, and a discussion, so the final paper is similar to a Standard Article.

BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY,,Wiley,,https://perma.cc/A9JQ-DQP8,0,,2,"Data Sharing and Data Accessibility

The British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology recognizes the many benefits of archiving data for scientific progress. Archived data provides an indispensable resource for the scientific community, making possible future replications and secondary analyses, in addition to the importance of verifying the dependability of published research findings.

The journal expects that where possible all data supporting the results in papers published are archived in an appropriate public archive offering open access and guaranteed preservation. The archived data must allow each result in the published paper to be recreated and the analyses reported in the paper to be replicated in full to support the conclusions made.  Authors are welcome to archive more than this, but not less.

All papers need to be supported by a data archiving statement and the data set must be cited in the Methods section. The paper must include a link to the repository in order that the statement can be published.

It is not necessary to make data publicly available at the point of submission, but an active link must be included in the final accepted manuscript. For authors who have pre-registered studies, please use the Registered Report link in the Author Guidelines.

In some cases, despite the authors’ best efforts, some or all data or materials cannot be shared for legal or ethical reasons, including issues of author consent, third party rights, institutional or national regulations or laws, or the nature of data gathered. In such cases, authors must inform the editors at the time of submission. It is understood that in some cases access will be provided under restrictions to protect confidential or proprietary information. Editors may grant exceptions to data access requirements provided authors explain the restrictions on the data set and how they preclude public access, and, if possible, describe the steps others should follow to gain access to the data.

If the authors cannot or do not intend to make the data publicly available, a statement to this effect, along with the reasons that the data is not shared, must be included in the manuscript.",0,"Supporting Information
